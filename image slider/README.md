## Image Slider: Swipe slides automatically

### Description

It is a small HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS demo. Five slide `div`s were placed in a stack and swiped automatically to display each.

### Core techniques

- JS implementation logic
  Swipe is implemented by manipulate the translateX value of slider `div`, this value is connected to the index number of each slide.

  Whenever the a left/right arrow button or one of the trail buttons at the bottom is clicked, the translateX value will be modified.

- CSS animation
  [GSAP Animation Library](https://greensock.com/gsap/) is used.
